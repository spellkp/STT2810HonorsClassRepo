</div>
<p>The goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which you’ll be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. To clarify which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.</p>
<p>As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage; however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.</p>
<div id="rstudio" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>RStudio</h2>
<p>Your RStudio window has four panels:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your R Markdown file (this document) is in the upper left panel.</p></li>
<li><p>The panel on the lower left is where the action happens. It’s called the <em>console</em>. Every time you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you’re running. Below that information is the <em>prompt</em>. As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a request for a command. Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.</p></li>
<li><p>The panel in the upper right contains your <em>workspace</em> as well as a history of the commands that you’ve previously entered.</p></li>
<li><p>Any plots that you generate will show up in the panel in the lower right corner. This is also where you can browse your files, access help, manage packages, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="r-packages" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>R Packages</h2>
<p>R is an open-source programming language, meaning that users can contribute packages that make our lives easier, and we can use them for free. For this lab, and many others in the future, we will use the following R packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>statsr</code>: for data files and functions used in this course</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code>: for data wrangling</li>
<li><code>ggplot2</code>: for data visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>You should have already installed these packages using commands like <code>install.packages</code> and <code>install_github</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you need to load the packages in your working environment. We do this with the <code>library</code> function. Note that you only need to <strong>install</strong> packages once, but you need to <strong>load</strong> them each time you relaunch RStudio.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(statsr)</code></pre>
<p>To do so, you can</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the green arrow at the top of the code chunk in the R Markdown (Rmd) file, or</li>
<li>highlight these lines, and hit the <strong>Run</strong> button on the upper right corner of the pane, or</li>
<li>type the code in the console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward you will be asked to load any relevant packages at the beginning of each lab.</p>
</div>
<div id="dataset-1-dr.arbuthnots-baptism-records" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Dataset 1: Dr. Arbuthnot’s Baptism Records</h2>
<p>To get you started, run the following command to load the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(arbuthnot)</code></pre>
<p>To do so, once again, you can</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the green arrow at the top of the code chunk in the R Markdown (Rmd) file, or</li>
<li>put your cursor on this line, and hit the <strong>Run</strong> button on the upper right corner of the pane, or</li>
<li>type the code in the console.</li>
</ul>
<p>This command instructs R to load some data. The Arbuthnot data records male and female christenings (births) in London from 1629 to 1710. You should see that the workspace area in the upper right hand corner of the RStudio window now lists a data set called <code>arbuthnot</code> that has 82 observations on 3 variables. As you interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the byproduct of a computation or some analysis you have performed.</p>
<p>The Arbuthnot data set refers to Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18<sup>th</sup> century physician, writer, and mathematician. He was interested in the ratio of newborn boys to newborn girls, so he gathered the baptism records for children born in London for every year from 1629 to 1710. We can take a look at the data by typing its name into the console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arbuthnot</code></pre>
<pre><code># A tibble: 82 × 3
    year  boys girls
   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
1   1629  5218  4683
2   1630  4858  4457
3   1631  4422  4102
4   1632  4994  4590
5   1633  5158  4839
6   1634  5035  4820
7   1635  5106  4928
8   1636  4917  4605
9   1637  4703  4457
10  1638  5359  4952
# ... with 72 more rows</code></pre>
<p>However, printing the whole dataset in the console is not that useful. One advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on the name <code>arbuthnot</code> in the <em>Environment</em> pane (upper right window) that lists the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the data set in the <em>Data Viewer</em> (upper left window). You can close the data viewer by clicking on the <em>x</em> in the upper left hand corner.</p>
<p>What you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a different year: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptized that year, respectively. Use the scrollbar on the right side of the console window to examine the complete data set.</p>
<p>Note that the row numbers in the first column are not part of Arbuthnot’s data. R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored Arbuthnot’s data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a <em>data frame</em>.</p>
<p>You can see the dimensions of this data frame by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dim(arbuthnot)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 82  3</code></pre>
<p>This command should output <code>[1] 82 3</code>, indicating that there are 82 rows and 3 columns (we’ll get to what the <code>[1]</code> means in a bit), just as it says next to the object in your workspace. You can see the names of these columns (or variables) by typing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(arbuthnot)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;year&quot;  &quot;boys&quot;  &quot;girls&quot;</code></pre>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

</div>
<p>You should see that the data frame contains the columns <code>year</code>, <code>boys</code>, and <code>girls</code>. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a lot like functions from mathematics; that is, invoking R commands means supplying a function with some number of arguments. The <code>dim</code> and <code>names</code> commands, for example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame.</p>
<div id="boxedtext">
<p><strong>Tip: </strong> If you use the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through your previous commands, your so-called command history. You can also access it by clicking on the history tab in the upper right panel. This will save you a lot of typing in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-markdown" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>R Markdown</h3>
<p>So far we asked you to type your commands in the console. The console is a great place for interacting with your code; however, it is not a good place for documenting your work. Working in the console exclusively makes it difficult to document your work as you go and to reproduce it later.</p>
<p>R Markdown is a great solution for this problem, and you already have worked with an R Markdown document—this lab! Going forward, type the code for the questions in the code chunks provided in the R Markdown (Rmd) document for the lab, and <strong>Knit</strong> the document to see the results.</p>
</div>
<div id="some-exploration" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Some Exploration</h3>
<p>Let’s start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access the data in a single column of a data frame separately using a command like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arbuthnot$boys</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1] 5218 4858 4422 4994 5158 5035 5106 4917 4703 5359 5366 5518 5470 5460
[15] 4793 4107 4047 3768 3796 3363 3079 2890 3231 3220 3196 3441 3655 3668
[29] 3396 3157 3209 3724 4748 5216 5411 6041 5114 4678 5616 6073 6506 6278
[43] 6449 6443 6073 6113 6058 6552 6423 6568 6247 6548 6822 6909 7577 7575
[57] 7484 7575 7737 7487 7604 7909 7662 7602 7676 6985 7263 7632 8062 8426
[71] 7911 7578 8102 8031 7765 6113 8366 7952 8379 8239 7840 7640</code></pre>
<p>This command will only show the number of boys baptized each year. The dollar sign basically says “go to the data frame that comes before me, and find the variable that comes after me.”</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls born?
<ol>
<li>
<code>arbuthnot$boys</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>arbuthnot$girls</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>girls</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>arbuthnot[girls]</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>$girls</code>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Type your code for the Question 2 here, and Knit.</code></pre>
<div id="answer">
<p>Type your answer for Question 2 here and delete this sentence.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the way R has printed these data is different. When we looked at the complete data frame, we saw 82 rows, one on each line of the display. These data are no longer structured in a table with other variables, they are displayed sequentially. Objects that print out in this way are called vectors; they represent a set of numbers. R has added numbers in [brackets] along the left side of the printout to indicate locations within the vector. For example, in the <code>arbuthnot$boys</code> vector, 5218 follows [1], indicating that 5218 is the first entry in the vector. And if [43] starts a line, then that would mean the first number on that line would represent the 43<sup>rd</sup> entry in the vector.</p>
<p>R has some powerful functions for making graphs. We can create a simple plot of the number of girls baptized per year with the command</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="Lab1_files/figure-html/plot-girls-vs-year-1.png" alt="Total number of girls baptized by year" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Total number of girls baptized by year
</p>
</div>
<p>Before we review the code for this plot, let’s summarize the trends we see in Figure @ref(fig:plot-girls-vs-year).</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Which of the following best describes the number of girls baptized over the years included in this dataset?
<ol>
<li>
There appears to be no trend in the number of girls baptized from 1629 to 1710.
</li>
<li>
There is initially an increase in the number of girls baptized, which peaks around 1640. After 1640 there is a decrease in the number of girls baptized, but the number begins to increase again in 1660. Overall the trend is an increase in the number of girls baptized.
</li>
<li>
There is initially an increase in the number of girls baptized. This number peaks around 1640 and then after 1640 the number of girls baptized decreases.
</li>
<li>
The number of girls baptized has decreased over time.
</li>
<li>
There is an initial increase in the number of girls baptized but this number appears to level around 1680 and not change after that time point.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<div id="answer">
<p>Type your answer to Question 3 here and delete this sentence.</p>
</div>
<p>Back to the code… We use the <code>ggplot()</code> function to build plots. If you run the plotting code in your console, you should see the plot appear under the <em>Plots</em> tab of the lower right panel of RStudio. Notice that the command above again looks like a function, this time with arguments separated by commas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first argument is always the dataset.</li>
<li>Next, we provide the variables from the dataset to be assigned to <code>aes</code>thetic elements of the plot, e.g. the x and the y axes.</li>
<li>Finally, we use another layer, separated by a <code>+</code> to specify the <code>geom</code>etric object for the plot. Since we want a scatterplot, we use <code>geom_point</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might wonder how you are supposed to know the syntax for the <code>ggplot</code> function. Thankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively. To read what a function does and learn the arguments that are available to you, just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you’re interested in. Try the following in your console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?ggplot</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel.</p>
<div id="boxedtext">
<p>More extensive help for plotting with the <code>ggplot2</code> package can be found at <a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/" class="uri">http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/</a>. The best (and easiest) way to learn the syntax is to examine the sample plots provided on that page and to modify the code bit by bit until you create the plot you want.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="r-as-a-big-calculator" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>R as a big calculator</h3>
<p>Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms. To compute this, we could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in mathematical expressions like</p>
<pre class="r"><code>5218 + 4683</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 9901</code></pre>
<p>to see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this once for each year, but there is a faster way. If we add the vector for baptisms for boys to that of girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1]  9901  9315  8524  9584  9997  9855 10034  9522  9160 10311 10150
[12] 10850 10670 10370  9410  8104  7966  7163  7332  6544  5825  5612

[78] 15369 16066 15862 15220 14928</code></pre>
<p>What you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we are not looking at a data frame here), each one representing the sum we’re after. Take a look at a few of them and verify that they are right.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-a-new-variable-to-the-data-frame" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Adding a new variable to the data frame</h3>
<p>We’ll be using this new vector to generate some plots, so we’ll want to save it as a permanent column in our data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arbuthnot &lt;- arbuthnot %&gt;%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)</code></pre>
<p>What in the world is going on here? The <code>%&gt;%</code> operator is called the <strong>piping</strong> operator. Basically, it takes the output of the current line and pipes it into the following line of code.</p>
<div id="boxedtext">
<p><strong>A note on piping:</strong> Note that we can read these three lines of code as the following:</p>
<p><em>“Take the <code>arbuthnot</code> dataset and <strong>pipe</strong> it into the <code>mutate</code> function. Using this mutate a new variable called <code>total</code> that is the sum of the variables called <code>boys</code> and <code>girls</code>. Then assign this new resulting dataset to the object called <code>arbuthnot</code>, i.e. overwrite the old <code>arbuthnot</code> dataset with the new one containing the new variable.”</em></p>
<p>This is essentially equivalent to going through each row and adding up the boys and girls counts for that year and recording that value in a new column called total.</p>

<p>You’ll see that there is now a new column called <code>total</code> that has been tacked on to the data frame. The special symbol <code>&lt;-</code> performs an <em>assignment</em>, taking the output of one line of code and saving it into an object in your workspace. In this case, you already have an object called <code>arbuthnot</code>, so this command updates that data set with the new mutated column.</p>
<p>We can create Figure @ref(fig:plot-total-vs-year-line), a plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the following command.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = total)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="Lab1_files/figure-html/plot-total-vs-year-line-1.png" alt="Total number of baptisms per year" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Total number of baptisms per year
</p>
</div>
<p>Note that using <code>geom_line()</code> instead of <code>geom_point()</code> results in a line plot instead of a scatter plot. You want both? Just layer them on:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = total)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<p><img src="Lab1_files/figure-html/plot-total-vs-year-line-and-point-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<div id="exercise">
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Create a plot of the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see?</p>

<p>Finally, in addition to simple mathematical operators like subtraction and division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater than, <code>&gt;</code>, less than, <code>&lt;</code>, and equality, <code>==</code>. For example, we can ask if boys outnumber girls in each year with the expression</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arbuthnot &lt;- arbuthnot %&gt;%

<p>This command add a new variable to the <code>arbuthnot</code> data frame containing the values of either <code>TRUE</code> if that year had more boys than girls, or <code>FALSE</code> if that year did not (the answer may surprise you). This variable contains different kind of data than we have considered so far. All other columns in the <code>arbuthnot</code> data frame have values are numerical (the year, the numbers of boys and girls). Here, we’ve asked R to create <em>logical</em> data, data where the values are either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>. In general, data analysis will involve many different data types, and one reason for using R is that it is able to represent and compute with many of them.</p>

<h2>Resources for learning R and working in RStudio</h2>
<p>That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more functions and a more complete sense of the language as the course progresses. You might find the following tips and resources helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In this course we will be using the <code>dplyr</code> (for data wrangling) and <code>ggplot2</code> (for data visualization) extensively. If you are googling for R code, make sure to also include these package names in your search query. For example, instead of googling “scatterplot in R”, google “scatterplot in R with ggplot2”.</p></li>
<li>The following cheat sheets may come in handy throughout the course. Note that some of the code on these cheat sheets may be too advanced for this course; however, the majority of it will become useful as you progress through the course material.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf">Data wrangling cheatsheet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf">Data visualization cheatsheet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf">R Markdown</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While you will get plenty of exercise working with these packages in the labs of this course, if you would like further opportunities to practice, we recommend working assignments in the relevant courses at <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses">DataCamp</a>.</p></li>
